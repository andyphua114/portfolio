# Andy's Portfolio
This is where I host some of my data analytics projects.

## Section 1: My learning journey through Dataquest.

#### [Project 1: Mobile Apps Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Mobile_App.ipynb)
* This project will analyse data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users. 
* This will help to increase of main source of revenue through in-app ads.

#### [Project 2: Hacker News Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Hacker_News.ipynb)
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

For this project, we're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question or Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
* Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
* Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

#### [Project 3: eBay Car Sales Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Car_Sales.ipynb)
The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

#### [Project 4: Heavy Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Heavy_Traffic.ipynb)
We're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.
