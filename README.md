# Andy's Portfolio
This is where I host some of my data analytics projects.

## Section 1: My learning journey through Dataquest.

#### [Project 1: Mobile Apps Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Mobile_App.ipynb)
This project will analyse data to help our developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users so as to increase of main source of revenue through in-app ads.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Opening and exploring data
* Cleaning data, such as removing wrong, duplicate, and irrelevant data
* Choosing the appropriate data
* Analysing data based on chosen parameters

#### [Project 2: Hacker News Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Hacker_News.ipynb)
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

For this project, we're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question or Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following: (!) do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average; and (2) do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Extracting the chosen data for analysis
* Calculating average for chosen parameters
* Sorting and printing values from a list of lists

#### [Project 3: eBay Car Sales Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Car_Sales.ipynb)
The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings. We'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data cleaning and exploration using pandas

#### [Project 4: Heavy Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Heavy_Traffic.ipynb)
We're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data cleaning and exploration using pandas
* Conduct exploratory data visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn

#### [Project 4: Euro Exchange Rate Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Exchange_Rates.ipynb)
The dataset we will use describes Euro daily exchange rates between 1999 and 2021. We will use this dataset to practise explanatory data visualisation.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data cleaning and exploration using pandas
* Conduct explanatory data visualisation using matplotlib
