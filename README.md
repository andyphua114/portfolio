# Andy's Portfolio
This is where I host some of my data analytics projects.

## Section 1: Competition/Self-Initiated Projects

#### [AI200 Capstone Project: Human or Robot?](https://github.com/andyphua114/self-projects/blob/main/Capstone_Project_Final.ipynb)
This Prediction Challenge is modelled after the 2015 Facebook Recruitment Challenge, a prediction competition jointly held by Facebook and Kaggle.

In this competition, we are chasing down robots for an online auction site. Human bidders on the site are becoming increasingly frustrated with their inability to win auctions vs. their software-controlled counterparts. As a result, usage from the site's core customer base is plummeting.

In order to rebuild customer happiness, the site owners need to eliminate computer generated bidding from their auctions. Their attempt at building a model to identify these bids using behavioral data, including bid frequency over short periods of time, has proven insufficient.

The goal of this competition is to identify online auction bids that are placed by "robots", helping the site owners easily flag these users for removal from their site to prevent unfair auction activity.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* More than 70 features created via feature engineering
* Hyperparameters tuning for Random Forest model
* Achieved a public score of 0.90561 and private score of 0.89190.

#### [Project Web Scrape: From Badminton World Federation Website](https://github.com/andyphua114/self-projects/blob/main/bwf_scrape.ipynb)
In this project, I was inspired by Loh Kean Yew's historic achievement of being the first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championships title at the BWF World Championships 2021 held in Huelva, Spain, I wanted to do some simple analysis on his meteoric rise to the top of the badminton world.

To start off, I felt that the BWF official website offers some match data that could be useful. Since I have just learnt about web scrapping, I decided to code and web scrape Loh Kean Yew's playing data from the BWF website.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Web scrape using BeautifulSoup and Selenium
* Extract data for chosen athelete (Loh Kean Yew)
* Export data to a csv file

#### [Project Loh Kean Yew](https://github.com/andyphua114/self-projects/blob/main/bwf_lky.ipynb)
In this project, I was inspired by Loh Kean Yew's historic achievement of being the first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championships title at the BWF World Championships 2021 held in Huelva, Spain, I wanted to do some simple analysis on his meteoric rise to the top of the badminton world.

Building off the data web scrapped from BWF website, I did a simple analysis on Loh Kean Yew's performance.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data wrangling
* Data visualisation

## Section 2: My learning journey through Dataquest.

#### [Project 1: Mobile Apps Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Mobile_App.ipynb)

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Opening and exploring data
* Cleaning data, such as removing wrong, duplicate, and irrelevant data
* Choosing the appropriate data
* Analysing data based on chosen parameters

#### [Project 2: Hacker News Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Hacker_News.ipynb)
Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of the Hacker News listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.

For this project, we're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question or Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just something interesting.

We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following: (!) do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average; and (2) do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Extracting the chosen data for analysis
* Calculating average for chosen parameters
* Sorting and printing values from a list of lists

#### [Project 3: eBay Car Sales Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Car_Sales.ipynb)

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data cleaning and exploration using pandas

#### [Project 4: Heavy Traffic Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Heavy_Traffic.ipynb)
We're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway.

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc. For instance, we may find out that the traffic is usually heavier in the summer or when it snows.

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data cleaning and exploration using pandas
* Conduct exploratory data visualisation using matplotlib and seaborn

#### [Project 5: Euro Exchange Rate Analysis](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Exchange_Rates.ipynb)

#### [Project 6: Clean and Analyse Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/andyphua114/learning-projects/blob/main/Employee_Exit.ipynb)
In this project, we played the role of data analyst and pretend our stakeholders want to know the following:
* Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
* Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

Through this project, I implemented the following:
* Data cleaning and exploration using pandas
